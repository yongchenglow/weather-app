# Commit Message Conventions

## Format
Follow Conventional Commits specification:
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

## Types
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## Guidelines
- Scope is optional but recommended
- Description should be in present tense and concise
- Use body for detailed explanation if needed
- Use footer for breaking changes or issue references

## Package Management
- Use yarn instead of npm for package management
